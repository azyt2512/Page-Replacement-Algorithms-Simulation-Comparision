# Page-Replacement-Algorithms-Simulation-Comparision
In this project different Page Replacement Algorithms of Operating System is simulated in table form and a Comparision Graph is designed using Canva.Js module to observe that Optimal Page Replacement Algorithm will have minimum page faults.
# Algorithms :
FIFO
LRU
MRU
Optimal Replacement
Second Chance Algorithm
# Simulation Description
i. First enter the no. of Frames availabe.
ii. Enter the refference string without any spaces then press "SIMULATE" button.
